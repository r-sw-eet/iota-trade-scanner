/**
 * On-chain raw facts snapshot. Stored verbatim from RPC/GraphQL — no
 * project/team/logo/description/TVL. Classification is applied at read time
 * against the current `ALL_PROJECTS`/`ALL_TEAMS` registry, so attributing a
 * new project retroactively re-labels every historical snapshot for free.
 *
 * Delta queries (events growth, storage growth, etc.) are plain subtraction
 * between two snapshots keyed by on-chain-stable `(address, module)`. See
 * `ecosystem-growth.ts` for the query path.
 *
 * Counters are **cumulative**, not deltas — every field holds the value
 * observed at capture time. That keeps any "state at time T" query O(1) in
 * snapshots and makes delta = `T2 - T1` trivially.
 *
 * Fields marked *reserved for future* have intentionally-empty slots today;
 * adding them is purely additive (old docs return `undefined`, which the
 * growth endpoint treats as "unknown for that interval", not zero):
 *   - `PackageFact.objectStorageBytes` / `.objectsLiveCount` — dynamic
 *     object-store growth (deferred; see `plans/TODO.md § Object-store growth`)
 *   - `PackageFact.firstCheckpoint` / `.latestCheckpoint` — first/last
 *     checkpoint the package was touched (derivable; deferred)
 *
 * `PackageFact.transactions` lives at package level (single `function:` filter
 * per package, cursor-model cumulative count). An earlier doc-comment reserved
 * a `ModuleMetrics.transactions` slot for per-module counting; abandoned
 * before use per `plans/plan_tx_count.md § Design decision` — every project
 * the metric rescues is single-module, so per-package halves the query budget
 * for the same data.
